# RUN_LOG.md — ablation run on macOS (Apple M3, 8 GB)

**Date:** 2026-09-23 · **Operator:** Claude Code, executing `TASK.md` end to end
**Outcome:** all 7 steps completed. Full ablation ran to completion on real Ollama
models with **zero** failed inference calls.

| Step | Status | Wall time |
|---|---|---|
| 1 Environment check | DONE (after installing Ollama) | ~3 min |
| 2 Setup (`bash setup.sh`) | DONE, exit 0 | 37 min 56 s |
| 3 Offline tests | DONE, 9/9 passed | 2.3 s |
| 4 Smoke run on Ollama | DONE, exit 0, no fixes needed | ~5 min |
| 5 Full ablation | DONE, exit 0 | 17 min 05 s |
| 6 Streamlit demo check | DONE, HTTP 200, clean stop | 20 s |
| 7 This log | DONE | — |

**Total run time: ≈ 66 minutes** (first environment probe ≈ 14:49 IST → demo check
stopped 15:54:40 IST). The single largest block was the ~7 GB of model downloads in
Step 2, which was slowed by a degraded uplink (see E3), not by the project.

## 1. Machine

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Model | Mac15,12 — Apple M3, arm64 |
| macOS | Darwin 25.6.0 |
| RAM | **8.0 GB** (`hw.memsize` = 8589934592) |
| Disk free, before / after | 22 GB → 14 GB on `/System/Volumes/Data` |
| Python (system probe) | 3.13.0 |
| Python (venv that actually ran everything) | **3.14.7** (Homebrew — see E4) |
| Ollama | **0.34.3**, installed during this run (see E1) |
| Ollama server flags | `OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1 OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0` |

## 2. Models actually used

This machine has exactly 8 GB of RAM, which triggers the small-model branch required by
`TASK.md` step 2. The substitution was applied to both `assistant/config.py` and
`setup.sh`. **Only the `"ollama"` backing-model string changed in each pool entry** — the
accuracy / cost / latency priors, the scoring weights, the gold answers and the scoring
logic were all left untouched.

| Pool slot | README default | **Used here** | Size |
|---|---|---|---|
| GPT *(= `FIXED_MODEL`, used by baseline/B/C)* | `qwen2.5-coder:7b` | `qwen2.5-coder:3b` | 1.9 GB |
| Claude | `llama3.1:8b` | `llama3.2:3b` | 2.0 GB |
| Gemini *(vision)* | `llava:7b` | `moondream` | 1.7 GB |
| Sonar | `llama3.2:3b` | `llama3.2:1b` | 1.3 GB |
| Embedder | `nomic-embed-text` | `nomic-embed-text` *(unchanged)* | 274 MB |

Download total: ~7 GB instead of ~15 GB. Provider `ollama`, embedder `ollama`
(768-dim `nomic-embed-text`), RAG index = 6 documents → 17 chunks.

**Caveat for the report:** these are 1B–3B models standing in for 7B–8B ones. Absolute
scores below are therefore lower than the same code would produce on the README's
default pool. The *relative* ordering between variants — which is what the ablation is
actually testing — is unaffected and comes out clean.

## 3. Intent metrics (`results/intent_metrics.json`)

Dataset: 1,350 queries, **1,080 train / 270 test**, split **per seed group** so
paraphrases of a test query never appear in training.

| Metric | Value |
|---|---|
| **Accuracy (grouped, honest)** | **0.8444** |
| **Macro F1** | **0.8440** |
| Accuracy (random split, leaky — do not report) | 1.0000 |
| n_total / n_train / n_test | 1350 / 1080 / 270 |

Per class (support = 54 each):

| Intent | Precision | Recall | F1 |
|---|---|---|---|
| coding | 1.000 | 0.722 | 0.839 |
| writing | 0.906 | 0.889 | 0.897 |
| search | 0.813 | 0.722 | 0.765 |
| reasoning | 0.696 | 0.889 | 0.780 |
| multimodal | 0.885 | 1.000 | 0.939 |

Confusion matrix (rows = true, order `coding, writing, search, reasoning, multimodal`):

```
coding      [39,  5,  3,  6,  1]
writing     [ 0, 48,  0,  0,  6]
search      [ 0,  0, 39, 15,  0]
reasoning   [ 0,  0,  6, 48,  0]
multimodal  [ 0,  0,  0,  0, 54]
```

The dominant error is **search → reasoning** (15 of 54). `reasoning` has the weakest
precision (0.696) because it absorbs misclassified `search` and `coding` queries.
This matches the ~84% the README predicts.

## 4. Full ablation table (`results/ablation.csv`)

Verbatim from the CSV:

```
model,routing,memory,rag,memory_recall,rag_accuracy,hallucination_rate,citation_rate
baseline,False,False,False,0.0,0.0,0.528,0.0
A,True,False,False,0.0,0.0,0.139,0.0
B,False,True,False,0.967,0.0,0.917,0.0
C,False,False,True,0.0,0.889,0.083,0.139
D,True,True,True,0.967,0.889,0.056,0.0
```

Rendered, with the extra columns from `ablation.json`:

| Variant | Routing | Memory | RAG | Memory recall | RAG accuracy | Hallucination ↓ | Abstention | Citation | Facts stored | Time |
|---|:--:|:--:|:--:|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline | | | | 0.000 | 0.000 | 0.528 | 0.472 | 0.000 | 0 | 92 s |
| Model A | x | | | 0.000 | 0.000 | **0.139** | 0.861 | 0.000 | 0 | 152 s |
| Model B | | x | | **0.967** | 0.000 | 0.917 | 0.083 | 0.000 | 19 | 200 s |
| Model C | | | x | 0.000 | **0.889** | 0.083 | 0.028 | 0.139 | 0 | 226 s |
| **Model D** | x | x | x | **0.967** | **0.889** | **0.056** | 0.056 | 0.000 | 19 | 352 s |

n = 30 memory recall questions, 36 RAG questions, per variant. 450 inference calls total.

**What the numbers say**

- **Memory is what produces recall.** 0.000 → 0.967 the moment the memory switch is on
  (B and D). 19 long-term facts were extracted from the 24 first-person statements.
- **RAG is what produces grounded answers.** 0.000 → 0.889 on the Helix Robotics
  questions, which are unanswerable without retrieval. Hallucination falls 0.528 → 0.083.
- **Routing alone cuts hallucination without adding knowledge** (baseline 0.528 → A
  0.139) — but purely by pushing the model to abstain (0.472 → 0.861). Model A's RAG
  accuracy is still 0.000. Routing makes the system *honest*, not *informed*.
- **Model D is the best row on every axis**: it keeps B's recall (0.967) and C's accuracy
  (0.889) while posting the lowest hallucination rate of any variant (**0.056**, a
  **9.4× reduction** vs. the 0.528 baseline). The three components compose rather than
  interfere, which is the claim the ablation exists to test.
- **Model B is the cautionary row.** Memory without retrieval gives the *worst*
  hallucination rate in the study (**0.917**). Given a question about a company it has no
  facts about, a memory-primed model confabulates instead of abstaining. Memory alone is
  actively harmful for factual grounding.

## 5. Routing gain

Computed by `routing_gain()` over the 270 held-out test intents: for each query, the
routed model's score minus the score each fixed model would have earned on that same query.

| Always-use-this-model | Gap vs. dynamic routing |
|---|---|
| GPT | +0.0952 |
| Claude | +0.1032 |
| Gemini | +0.0600 |
| Sonar | +0.0752 |
| **Mean gap** | **+0.0834** |

Routing beats every fixed model, so there is no single model you could pin and match it.
The gain is largest against **Claude** (+0.1032) — the highest-cost, highest-latency entry
in the pool, penalised hardest by the `0.6/0.2/0.2` weighting — and smallest against
**Gemini** (+0.0600), the most balanced generalist. Figure: `results/routing_gain.png`.

## 6. Honest-reporting notes

Nothing in `data/eval/`, `data/corpus/` or `data/intents.csv` was edited by hand. No gold
answer and no scoring function was touched. Verified: every file in `data/eval/` and
`data/corpus/` still carries its original checkout mtime, and the only two source files
modified in this run are `assistant/config.py` and `setup.sh`.

`data/intents.csv` *does* carry a fresh mtime, because `setup.sh` regenerates it via
`scripts/make_intent_dataset.py` as a normal pipeline step. That script is seeded
(`random.seed(7)`), so this is a deterministic rebuild, not a change: regenerating it a
second time and diffing against the pre-existing file returned **identical** output
(1,350 rows, same split assignment). No label, query or split was altered.

Two results are worse than one might want, and are reported as-is rather than tuned away:

1. **Citation rate is ~0 everywhere** (C = 0.139, D = **0.000**), even though D answers
   88.9% of RAG questions correctly and the system prompt explicitly says to cite `[1]`,
   `[2]`. The 1B–3B substitute models simply do not follow the citation instruction
   reliably; `qwen2.5-coder:3b` (which C uses as the fixed model) complies occasionally,
   and the models D routes to comply never. This is a **consequence of the 8 GB
   small-model substitution**, and is the one metric where the substitution clearly costs
   something. It would very likely recover on the README's 7B/8B pool. It was left alone.
2. **Model B's 0.917 hallucination rate** is the worst number in the study. It is a real
   and interesting finding (see above), not a bug.

## 7. Errors hit and how they were fixed

### E1 — Ollama not installed (Step 1) · fixed

`ollama --version` → `command not found`. `/usr/local/bin/ollama` existed but was a
**dangling symlink** to `/Applications/Ollama.app/Contents/Resources/ollama`; the app had
been deleted. `~/.ollama/models` still held 3.8 GB of orphaned blobs (`mistral:latest`
only) and nothing was listening on port 11434.

**Fix:** installed the CLI/server via the existing Homebrew — `brew install ollama` →
0.34.3, no sudo, no GUI app, reversible. Started the server in the background with the
memory-friendly flags Homebrew recommends:

```
OLLAMA_FLASH_ATTENTION=1 OLLAMA_KV_CACHE_TYPE=q8_0 ollama serve
```

Server came up on `localhost:11434` in 7 s. The orphaned `mistral:latest` blobs were left
in place (explicit user decision) and are unused by this project.

### E2 — 8 GB RAM: small-model substitution (Step 2) · applied as required

Required by `TASK.md` step 2. Details and the full mapping are in section 2 above.

*Self-inflicted slip, logged for completeness:* the first edit pass applied the four
substitutions as sequential string replacements, so the `llama3.2:3b` freshly written into
the **Claude** slot was then matched by the **Sonar** rule and rewritten to `llama3.2:1b`,
leaving Claude and Sonar swapped. Caught by re-reading the file immediately after the
edit; corrected with line-targeted edits and verified by resolving the pool through
`providers._backend_model()`. The final mapping is the table in section 2.

### E3 — model pull stalled repeatedly on a degraded uplink (Step 2) · waited out

Partway through `setup.sh`, the `llama3.2:3b` pull began oscillating (56% → 25% → 52%)
and `ollama serve` logged `part N stalled; retrying` for all 16 parallel parts. The
per-part metadata in `~/.ollama/models/blobs/*-partial-*` showed `"Completed":0` across
the board — no durable progress for ~15 minutes.

**Diagnosis:** not an Ollama or project fault. Measured throughput at that moment:

| Target | Speed |
|---|---|
| Cloudflare speedtest (generic) | 2.7 MB/s (was ~11 MB/s 15 min earlier) |
| github.com release tarball | 0.52 MB/s |
| Ollama R2 CDN, single stream | 0.24 MB/s |

All three unrelated CDNs were slow together, so the whole uplink had degraded.

**Fix:** none in code — waited it out. The link recovered and all five models completed
and verified. No flag changed, no pull skipped, no model substituted for a smaller one to
dodge the download. Total pull wall time ~37 min for ~7 GB.

### E4 — venv Python is 3.14.7, not the 3.13.0 probed in Step 1 (benign) · accepted

Step 1 probed `python3` → 3.13.0. By the time `setup.sh` ran, `/opt/homebrew/bin` had
been prepended to `PATH` (needed to reach the freshly brewed `ollama`), so
`python3 -m venv` resolved to Homebrew's **3.14.7** instead. Both satisfy the 3.10+
requirement; the full dependency set installed cleanly and 9/9 tests passed on it, so the
venv was left as-is rather than rebuilt. Recorded so the reported Python version matches
what actually executed.

### Errors that did *not* occur

Worth stating explicitly, since `TASK.md` step 4 anticipated them: across **518**
`/api/chat` calls (68 smoke + 450 full ablation) there were **zero** non-200 responses —
no timeouts, no wrong model names, no Ollama errors, no OOM despite 8 GB of RAM with
models being swapped in and out by the router. The existing `timeout=600` in
`providers.py` was never approached; the slowest single call was ~21 s.
**No code fix was needed for crashes, timeouts or compatibility.** The only source
changes in this entire run are the four model-name strings in `assistant/config.py` and
the matching pull list in `setup.sh`.
